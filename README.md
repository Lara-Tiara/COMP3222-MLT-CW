# COMP3222-MLT-CW based on the MediaEval 2015 "verifying multimedia use" task

## Overview
This project involves developing machine learning models to accurately classify social media posts as real or fake. The goal is to apply various data preprocessing and feature extraction techniques to optimize model performance.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy

## Features
- Data Preprocessing: Tokenization, lemmatization, and removal of irrelevant data.
- Feature Extraction: Utilizing TF-IDF for converting text data into a suitable format for ML models.
- Models: Experimentation with SVM and Random Forest models, including hyperparameter tuning.
